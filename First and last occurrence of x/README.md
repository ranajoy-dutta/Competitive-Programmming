## Find first and last occurrence of x
> **Given a sorted array with possibly duplicate elements, the task is to find indexes of first and last occurrences of an element x in the given array.**

**Input Format**
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the no of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains an integer N denoting the size of the array. Then in the next line are N space separated values of the array. The last line of each test case contains an integer x.


**Output Format** 
For each test case in a new line print two integers separated by space denoting the first and last occurrence of the element x. If the element is not present in the array print -1.

**Constraints**
0<=T<=100
0< Number of Digits in Integer <=1000000
